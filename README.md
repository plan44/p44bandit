# p44bandit - daemon for communicating with BANDIT CNC mill control

- For running on OpenWrt targets such as Onion Omega2, you may want to use the p44banditd and p44bandit-config packages from the [plan44 feed](https://github.com/plan44/plan44-openwrt-feed.git).
- See *QCAD-postprocessor* subdirectory for a exporter script for QCAD/CAM-Pro to generate BANDIT compatible G-Code
